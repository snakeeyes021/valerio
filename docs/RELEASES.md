## **Release v0.1.2-alpha (Current State)**
**Date:** 2026-05-09
**Status:** Alpha / Work-in-Progress

**Description:** Validated minor update of Dorico (6.2.20.6183) installed via the existing SDA installation. Includes partial testing of 3rd-party VST (Cantai).

**Build Environment Artifacts:**
*   **Custom Wine Source (`zhiyi/wine`):** Commit `ae88a705b5aa544cc60153d48c1ca8849f32ee14`
*   **Winetricks Version:** `20260125-next` (SHA256: `8f07319f32e96a7ad92f786bf8ee2e00d3c65f82debd33b6884e681b825ae67a`)
*   **Wine-ICU MSI Version:** `72.1`

**Verified Application Versions:**
*   **Steinberg Download Assistant (SDA):** `1.39.3`
*   **Steinberg Activation Manager (SAM):** `1.8.1.1383`
*   **Steinberg Media Bay:** `1.3.60`
*   **Dorico:** `6.2.20.6183` (AudioEngine version `6.1.0.13`)
*   **NotePerformer (3rd Party):** `5.1.2`
*   **Cantai (3rd Party):** `2.2.0` PARTIAL (see note below)

**Known Issues (in this environment):**
*   **New:** SDA attempts to update MediaBay automatically and fails.
*   **New:** 3rd-party Cantai VST testing is inconclusive. While it installs and the playback template loads and seems to load the correct amount of instances, license activation requires opening the VST window, which currently crashes Dorico in this build (and all previous builds).
*   Visual glitches (transparent text) in SDA.
*   `VSTAudioEngine6.exe` crashes cleanly upon closing Dorico.
*   Wine DPI scaling may need to be manually set on any given display, e.g. high-resolution (4K) displays.
