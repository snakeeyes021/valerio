# Project Backlog

This document is the single source of truth for all tasks, bugs, and enhancements.

## Defined Work (Sprint)
This section tracks epics that have been broken down into concrete, actionable subtasks.

### Epic: The Master Installer Wrapper
**Context:** We need a single-command `curl | bash` installation experience so Linux novices don't have to manually run individual scripts.

#### Subtasks: Missing Component Scripts
We currently have `install_noteperformer.sh`, but we lack dedicated automation scripts for the core Steinberg components. Before we can build the master wrapper, we must build and test:
*   [ ] **`install_sda.sh`**:
    *   Must use a generalized glob pattern (e.g., `Steinberg_Download_Assistant_*_Installer_win.exe`) to find the user-provided installer regardless of the version number they downloaded.
    *   Must handle the execution inside the container prefix.
*   [ ] **`install_mediabay.sh`**:
    *   Currently, `setup_prefix.sh` unzips the MediaBay installer and deletes the broken `preinstall.ps1` file, but it doesn't *run* the actual setup.
    *   Need a dedicated script that navigates into the `MediaBay_extracted/` directory, dynamically finds the subfolder (e.g., `MediaBay 1.3.60` — this must be dynamic as versions will change), and executes `wine Setup.exe`.

#### Subtasks: The "one-click" Bootstrapper (`install.sh`)
*   [ ] **Prerequisite Checks:** Script must check for `distrobox` (or `distroshelf`) and `docker`/`podman`. If missing, halt and print clear instructions to install them.
*   [ ] **Asset Validation:** Ensure an `installers/` directory exists and prompt the user to drop their `.exe` files into it before continuing.
*   [ ] **Execution Chain:** Sequentially call `build_wine.sh` -> `setup_prefix.sh` -> `install_sda.sh` -> `install_mediabay.sh` -> `install_noteperformer.sh`.

### Epic: UX/UI Desktop Integration
**Context:** Distrobox auto-exports `.desktop` files with icons, but we need our custom `.desktop` files to handle the `net-steinberg-sam://` URI schemes. 

#### Subtasks: .desktop File Merging
*   [ ] The stubs in `desktop_stubs/` currently lack `Icon=` paths. 
*   [ ] Need a post-install script that runs `distrobox-export --app` for SDA, SAM, and Dorico.
*   [ ] Extract the generated `Icon=` lines from the Distrobox-exported files located in the host's `~/.local/share/applications/`.
*   [ ] Inject those Icon paths into our custom URI-handler stubs and overwrite the Distrobox ones, ensuring the user gets one clean icon that launches the app *and* handles the login links.

### Epic: Engine Dependency Automation (libicu)
**Context:** Wine requires native ICU support for core Unicode translation, and Steinberg apps require Windows-side ICU binaries within the prefix.
*   [ ] **Native Dependencies:** Add `libicu-dev` and `libicu-dev:i386` to the `apt-get install` list in `scripts/1-build/build_wine.sh`.
*   [ ] **Prefix Dependencies:** Add the silent download and installation of `wine-icu-72.1-x86.msi` and `wine-icu-72.1-x86_64.msi` to `scripts/2-install/setup_prefix.sh`.
*   [ ] **Cleanup:** Delete `scripts/1-build/TO_BE_DELETED_rebuild_wine_icu.sh` once the above are verified working in a fresh build.

### Epic: Documentation & Repository Polish
**Context:** Prepare the repository for public consumption and preserve AI agent context.
*   [ ] **Update Main README:** Refactor `README.md` to be strictly user-facing (What is it, prerequisites, installation). Move developer/architectural deep-dives to `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.
*   [ ] **Add Standard Open Source Docs:** Create `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `LICENSE` files.

## Undefined Work (Backlog)
This section tracks high-level goals and ideas that have not yet been broken down into concrete subtasks.

*   [ ] **Production Path Refactoring:** Transition from isolated development paths (`~/dev/...`) to standard production paths. Scripts must be updated to dynamically generate the Wine prefix in a user-agnostic XDG location (e.g., `~/.local/share/wineprefixes/dorico`) rather than the repo directory.
*   [ ] **The Master Installer Wrapper (User Experience):** Assuming Steinberg legal does not allow pre-packaged distribution, the end-user will need to provide their own `.exe` and `.zip` installers. We must not force Linux novices to use `git clone` or run multiple shell scripts. We need to architect a "one-click" bootstrapper:
    1. **The Curl Command:** A single terminal command (e.g., `curl -sL ... | bash`) that users copy/paste from the GitHub README to download the installer framework.
    2. **Prerequisite Check:** The script must check if Distrobox/Distroshelf and Docker/Podman are installed (prompting the user to install them via Flatpak/system packages if missing).
    3. **The Wrapper:** Once prerequisites are met, the script detects the provided Steinberg installer files, bootstraps the container prefix, sequentially executes the software installers, and automatically registers the `.desktop` stubs and MIME types.
*   [ ] **High-DPI / 4K Scaling:** Wine isn't scaling automatically on one particular 4K 28" screen (not sure about other 4K screens). We need to investigate Wine DPI registry keys or a dynamic DPI switcher alias.
*   [ ] **VSTAudioEngine6.exe Crash:** The audio engine crashes cleanly upon closing Dorico. This does not prevent proper function of the application; it's just ugly/annoying. Need to investigate if this is a Pipewire/ASIO routing issue or a Wine teardown bug.
*   [ ] **Visual Glitches / GE-Proton Experiment:** The current `zhiyi/wine` build has transparent text in SDA and font ugliness. Create an experimental Git branch to try patching `dcomp` directly onto an *optimal* version of GE-Proton (known working verison of GE Proton without the visual glitches: GE Proton 10.33, but we probably want to test against either GE Proton current, GE Proton rc, or whatever GE Proton matches zhiyi/wine).
*   [ ] **GNOME / Adwaita Theming:** Investigate applying a Windows `.msstyles` theme to make Wine scrollbars and menus match GNOME/Adwaita natively. Explore having this run automatically if GNOME is detected. Consider doing the same for KDE, or just leaving it for KDE and all other DEs.
*   [ ] **Desktop Shortcut Cleanup (UX/UI):** Distrobox auto-exported `.desktop` files with proper icons, conflicting with our custom manual ones. Use the current "messy" state of this machine as a diagnostic baseline to merge the "Nice Icon" with the "Functional Link Handler" and establish actual scripted functionality. *Must also recover `steinberg-sda-handler.sh` from the host system and commit it, along with `.desktop` file templates, directly to the repository.*
*   [ ] **Version Manifest Generation:** Programmatically extract and record the exact version numbers of every piece of installed Steinberg software to create a reproducible manifest.
*   [ ] **"License Eater" Bug:** On prior attempts in Bottles, a (assumed) hardware fingerprinting issue is causing licenses to disappear. Determine if the issue exists under our current method, and, if so, figure out a strategy for maintaining hardware fingerprint (if that is the problem).
*   [ ] **NotePerformer UI:** Fix graphical glitches in the NotePerformer VST window. (Determine if this is still an issue under the current custom Wine build).
